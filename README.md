# Domain Generalization in Generalized Category Discovery (DG-GCD) in Hyperbolic Space

This repository contains an initial implementation of a meta-training framework for tackling the **DG-GCD (Domain Generalization in Generalized Category Discovery)** problem using **hyperbolic geometry**. It draws inspiration from the CVPR 2025 paper *"When Domain Generalization meets Generalized Category Discovery: An Adaptive Task-Arithmetic Driven Approach"*, extending its core ideas into the non-Euclidean setting for better hierarchical representation and generalization.
